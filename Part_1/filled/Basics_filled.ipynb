    " - *How to think like a Computer Scientist*. Some of the structure and ideas of the first few chapters have been used for this course.\n",
    " - *A Whirlwind Tour of Python* has a faster pace, and seems to be targeted at a more technically-minded audience.\n",
    " - *Software Carpentry* is an organisation aimed at providing basic software training for everyone. They have a \"<ins>train the trainers</ins>\" approach, which means that they provide material and training courses for software carpentry trainers. Thankfully, you are also allowed to access and use their material for free. This training course here gives a Python introduction at hands of a practical data processing task.\n"

    " - As I said before, ``print`` expects a string or something that can be converted to a string. Here are some examples of what happens if I am dealing with integers. Please try each of these examples for yourself, and see what the output is. One will give you an error. In the 1st case, the interpreter recognises that I have two integers that want to be added together, and gives me the answer. The 2nd case produces an error and says ``TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str``. The plus sign actually means two different things for numbers and for strings! You can *glue* two strings together using the plus sign, and you can add two numbers together, as we would expect. The 3rd case shows how to explicitly cast a number to a string. We tell it ``add 2 and 5 together, make it a string, and concatenate it to the other string''.\n",
    " - To make things a bit more complicated (or easier, depending on your point of view), you can do the same things by simply putting a comma instead of the plus in the print statement. Ask me about the meaning behind that at the end, when we have talked about functions!"

Generally, if you have something like a plus b plus c, it happens from left to right: First a plus b, and then plus c. However, if you have exponents, like a to the power of b to the power of c, the right-most operations happens first: b to the power of c, and then a to the power of the result. Exponents bind stronger than times and division, i.e. exponents are computed first, and times and division is stronger than plus and minus. If in doubt, just use parenthesis.\n",
